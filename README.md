# EnvInstall

This repository serves as a collection of installation and update scripts for the tools I frequently utilize.

The primary objective is to facilitate the installation of all essential tools on a target machine using simple commands.

Feel free to use these scripts, however, I advise against it as they are tailored to fulfill my specific requirements.

## Installation

### Requirements:
- Debian 12+
- wget

```
